‚ùì PROMPT
You are asked to design a simple printer queue.

The printer can only perform one operation at a time and processes the print jobs in the order they are added to the queue. The actions parameter is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains one of the following commands:

("add", "document_name"): Add a new document to the print queue.
("print",): Print the next document in the queue.
("cancel", "document_name"): Cancel a document in the queue. If the document is not in the queue, do nothing.
The function should return a list of strings representing the names of the printed documents in the order they were printed.

Example(s)
actions = [
    ("add", "doc1"),    # Add 'doc1' to the queue
    ("add", "doc2"),    # Add 'doc2' to the queue
    ("print",),         # Print 'doc1' from the queue to the printed queue
    ("cancel", "doc1"), # Remove 'doc1' from the queue (do nothing)
    ("add", "doc3"),    # Add 'doc3' to the queue
    ("print",),         # Print 'doc2' from the queue to the printed queue
    ("print",)          # Print 'doc3' from the queue to the printed queue
]

result = printer_queue(actions)
print(result)  # Output: ['doc1', 'doc2', 'doc3']

Hint: What is the difference between a stack and a queue, and why do we use a queue in this question?

A: Queues follow First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, whereas Stacks are Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. We use a queue in this particular problem because the documents added to the queue should be printed in the order it was added.


üîé EXPLORE
List your assumptions & discoveries:
 - we are creating two Queues, one to store the docs, second queue to store the docs that have been printed

Insightful & revealing test cases:
 - can the input actions be empty => yes
 - can we have duplicate input elements => no
 - can we have incorrect input elements => no

üß† BRAINSTORM
What approaches could work?
Algorithm 1: Traversal approach
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n + n) ~ O(2n) ~ O(n)


üìÜ PLAN
Outline of algorithm #:
    Create a empty queue (array) to add docs to be printed
    Create a empty printedQueue (array) to store already printed docs
    Traverse the input actions and at each actions
        if action is add => add the doc to queue
        if action is cancel => remove doc from queue
        if action is print => remove doc from queue
                              add doc to printed queue


üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENT
function printerQueue(actions) {) // returns list
def printer_queue(actions: list) -> list:


üß™ VERIFY
Run tests. Methodically debug & analyze issues.
